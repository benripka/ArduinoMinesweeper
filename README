Notes: Some code(along with comments) provided in class was reused indirectly throughout the assignment
accessories:
*1 Arduino Mega Board
*1 joystick
*1 LCD screen
*1 SD card w/ map of edmonton+restaurant data

Wiring: from bottom to top on the right side (the side with the pins).

Instructions:
1. Insert SD card
2. Compile and upload code

Features:
1.Playing board that is navigable with the joystick
2.Algorithm that places a certain number of mines based on the difficulty selected
before the game begins
3.Pressing the button on the joystick will clear surrounding spaces that do not
contain the mines
4.Numbers will be displayed on tiles that are adjacent to mines. The the
number displayed refers to the number of adjacent mines
5.Clearing all the free spaces will result in a perfect score
6.Score is counted based on number of cleared spaces
7.At the end of the game the score will be displayed on the screen, then after
certain time period it will restart.
8.Separate button for flag placement
9.'Custom' game mode which uses a potentiometer to adjust a certain number of 
mines


1st Milestone: v0.07 23/11/2017
	-Playing Board implemented which cursor controlled by the joystick that is
	able to navigate the screen. Pressing the button on the cursor on top of a mine
	will end the game
	-Algorithm places mines(not based on difficulty, just set value)
	-Board does not clear spaces
	-Score function structure is present but not functional
